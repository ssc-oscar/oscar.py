  <p>Starting version 1.3, <cite>oscar</cite> is compiled from Cython, a language closely
resembling Python but with optional strong typing to improve performance.
Building Cython packages requires few extra build steps, as explained below.</p>
<p>In addition, automation in this project relies on few assumptions which you are
expected to follow. Below you can find their brief description and the motivation
behind.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-to-contribute">
<h1>How to contribute<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-contribute" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>All the development is done on feature branches, which are then merged to <cite>master</cite>
via pull requests. Every pull request triggers unit testing, every merge triggers
a release.</p>
<p>To generate release notes, we use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org">conventional commits</a>,
a convention to commit messages. In a nutshell, it means commit messages should
be prefixed with one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>fix:</strong> in case the change fixes a problem without changing any interfaces.</dt><dd><p>Example commit message: <cite>fix: missing clickhouse-driver dependency (closes #123)</cite>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl class="simple">
<dt><strong>feat:</strong> the change implements a new feature, without affecting existing</dt><dd><p>interfaces. Example: <cite>feat: implement author timeline</cite>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><dl>
<dt>other prefixes, e.g. <cite>chore:</cite>, <cite>refactor:</cite>, <cite>docs:</cite>, <cite>test:</cite>, <cite>ci:</cite>, etc.</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>these will not be included in release notes and will not trigger a new</p></li>
</ul>
<p>release without new features or fixes added, unless contain breaking changes
(see below).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In case of breaking changes (i.e. if any interfaces were changed, breaking
backward compatibility), commit message should include an exclamation mark before
the semicolon, or contain <strong>BREAKING CHANGE</strong> in the footer, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><cite>feat!: drop support for deprectated parameters</cite></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><cite>fix</cite>, <cite>chore</cite>, <cite>docs</cite> commits will produce patch versions, <cite>feat</cite> will result
in a minor version bump, and in case of breaking changes the major version will
be incremented. As a consequence, <strong>you must never change version number manually</strong>.</p>
<p>Not following these procedures might take your pull request extra time to
review and in some cases will require rewriting the commit history.</p>

<div class="section" id="about-cython">
<h1>About Cython<a class="headerlink" href="#about-cython" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The reason to use Cython was primarily Python 3 support. WoC data is stored
in tokyocabinet (.tch) files, without native Python support.
<cite>libtokyocabinet</cite> binding, <cite>python-tokyocabinet</cite>, is a C extension supporting
Python 2 only, and lack of development activity suggests updating it for Py 3
is hardly considered. So, our options to interface <cite>libtokyocabinet</cite> were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>cffi (C Foreign Functions Interface) - perhaps, the simplest option,
but it does not support conditional definitions (<cite>#IFDEF</cite>), that are
actively used in tokyocabinet headers</p></li>
<li><p>C extension, adapting existing <cite>python-tokyocabinet</cite> code for Python 3.
It is rather hard to support and even harder to debug; a single
attempt was scrapped after making a silently failing extension.</p></li>
<li><p>SWIG, a Google project to generate C/C++ library bindings
for pretty much any language. Since this library provides 1:1 interface
to the library methods, Python clients had to be aware of the returned
C structures used by libtokyocabinet, which was very inconvenient.</p></li>
<li><p>Cython, a weird mix of Python and C. It allows writing Python interfaces,
while simultaneously using C functions. This makes it the ideal option
for our purposes, providing a Python tch file handler holding working
with libtokyocabinet C structures under the hood.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Cython came a clear winner in this comparison, also helping to speed up
some utility functions along the way (e.g. <cite>fnvhash</cite>, a pure Python version
of which was previously used).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="compiling-and-packaging">
<h1>Compiling and packaging<a class="headerlink" href="#compiling-and-packaging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To compile oscar locally, run:
<cite>python setup.py build_ext –inplace</cite>. To explicitly specify python version,
replace <cite>pyhon</cite>, with the appropriate version, e.g. <cite>python2</cite>.
There shorter alias for this command, <cite>make build</cite>, will always use the default
Python.</p>
<p>If you are building for several Python versions in a row without changing the
code (e.g. to check if it compiles at all), make sure you clean up first by
running <cite>make clean</cite>.
Compilation is cached when possible, and will be omitted if the input hasn’t
changed - the compiler is not aware that the resulting <cite>.so</cite> file exposes
different interfaces. You will get a lot of angry messages about missing
interfaces and symbols when import with the same Python version which “compiled”
this <cite>.so</cite> just a second ago in this case.</p>
<p>Packaging is slightly more complicated than just compiling since oscar needs to
support at least Python 2.7 and 3.6 simultaneously, meaning we need to package
multiple binaries. Fortunately, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/">PEP 513</a>
offers support for such packages. Building is done via <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/manylinux">manylinux</a>,
a special Docker image, and is automated via GitHub action.</p>
<p>To build package locally,</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>clone the corresponding GitHub action repository,</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p><cite>git clone git&#64;github.com:RalfG/python-wheels-manylinux-build.git</cite>,</p>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><p>check out the desired tag if necessary, e.g. <cite>git checkout v0.3.3</cite></p></li>
<li><p>build Docker image: <cite>docker build -t manylinux2010 .</cite></p></li>
<li><p>run the image: <cite>make build_manylinux</cite></p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing">
<h1>Testing<a class="headerlink" href="#testing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Every push to oscar repository is automatically tested; on top, you might want
to test locally before making a commit to avoid awkward followup fixes and a
bunch of angry emails from GitHub actions bot telling how you broke the build.
Unit tests are tedious to write, but will save a lot of your time in the long run.
First thing to know about  unit tests, please DO write them - future you will be
grateful. Second, there are a couple things about testing Cython code against a
remote dataset.</p>
<p>To run tests locally, <cite>make test_local</cite>.
WoC files are only available on UTK servers only, so to make local testing
possible, there is a small subset of the data in <cite>tests/fixtures</cite>. Changing
oscar paths to point at these fixtures requires setting some environment
variables, stored in <cite>tests/local_test.env</cite>.
To tests locally,</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>set environment variables, <cite>source tests/local_test.env</cite></p></li>
<li><p>clean up previously compiled binaries to avoid Py2/3 compatibility issues:</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p><cite>make clean</cite></p>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><p>run the test script: <cite>PYTHONPATH=. python tests/unit_test.py</cite>. Don’t forget to</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>replace <cite>python</cite> with a specific version if testing against non-default Python)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><cite>make test_local</cite> is a shortcut for this, except it will always use the default
Python and thus doesn’t need to clean.</p>
<p>Unit tests for Cython functions (i.e., defined with <cite>cdef</cite>) are stored in a
separate <cite>.pyx</cite> file, which is imported from the regular <cite>.py</cite> test suite.
Cython code can only be accessed from Cython files, which cannot executed as a
Python script. Thus, we have to store them separately - see <cite>tests/unit_test.py</cite>
and <cite>tests/unit_test_cy.pyx</cite> as an example of how it is organized.</p>
<p>To avoid manual compilation with <cite>cythonize</cite>, Cython tests are compiled with
<cite>pyximport</cite>, an in-place JIT compiler. Thus, at the beginning of every test suite,
install <cite>pyximport</cite>:</p>
<p>To tell <cite>pyximport</cite> where to find sources and libraries for the main module,
there is a special file <cite>oscar.pyxbld</cite>. It is important to keep it consistent
with the <cite>Extension</cite> parameters in <cite>setup.py</cite>. If you can <cite>make build</cite> but unit
tests fail to compile it, this is the first place to check.</p>
<p>Cython functions being tested should be exposed in <cite>oscar.pxd</cite> -
a Cython equivalent of a header file. If tests cannot find some function that is
defined in oscar, check it is included there. Hopefully, the list of tested
functions will grow bigger with your help.</p>
<p>Finally, unit and integration tests can also be run on real data. On one of UTK
servers (preferably, <cite>da4</cite>), clone the repository and run <cite>make test</cite>. If the
result is different from your local run, perhaps it’s time to update fixtures
and/or tests.</p>
